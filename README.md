## Why NestJS?

### Structured and Scalable Architecture
NestJS provides a highly structured and scalable architecture by default. It uses TypeScript and encourages the use of decorators and dependency injection, which helps in building modular and maintainable code. The framework is built with scalability in mind, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.

### Built-in Support for GraphQL
NestJS has built-in support for GraphQL through its dedicated package `@nestjs/graphql`. This integration is seamless and allows for easy setup and management of GraphQL APIs. The tight integration with Apollo GraphQL ensures that developers can take full advantage of GraphQL's features with minimal configuration.

### TypeScript First Approach
NestJS is built with TypeScript, which brings type safety and better tooling to the development process. TypeScript helps in catching errors at compile time and makes the code more readable and maintainable. This is a significant advantage over frameworks like Express, which primarily use JavaScript.

### Dependency Injection
NestJS uses dependency injection as a core principle, which helps in managing dependencies and enhancing code modularity and testability. This feature is not inherently available in vanilla Node.js or even in other frameworks like Express or Fastify without additional libraries.

### Extensive Documentation and Community Support
NestJS has extensive documentation and a growing community, which makes it easier for developers to find resources and get help when needed. The framework's documentation is well-organized and provides detailed information on various aspects of the framework.

### Robust Ecosystem
NestJS has a robust ecosystem with a wide range of modules that cover various functionalities such as microservices, WebSockets, and more. This ecosystem helps in building complex applications without having to rely heavily on third-party libraries.
